#PyCity Schools

##Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine how the schools in the PyCity school district preformed based on reading and math metrics from a standardized test.  The analysis was broken down in to several categories or organization, among them, the type of school (charter vs district), the size of the student body in a school, and how much was spent on each student in the school.  In this part of the analysis, we also negated the scores on reading and math for the freshman class in Thomas High School since there was a suspicion of cheating on the assessment.

##Results
In general, the results were not changed drastically when the Thomas 9th graders were pulled out of the data, as shown below:

###How is the district summary affected?
There was not a significant change from the district summary perspective.  The changes at this level are practically non-existent as the change in average math score was a 0.1 decrease, and there was no change in the average reading score.  The overall pass rates dipped a little too, but it is hard to tell from the district data if this was because of cheating, or because the data from a high preforming school was taken out. 

###How is the school summary affected?
The school summary shows a little bit more of a deviation than the district summary.  A closer analysis shows that the students in the 9th grade at Thomas preformed at about the same level as the average score for the other students at Thomas.  This deviation is not apparent in the average scores for the math and reading assessments, but it does show in the percent of students that passed the exams.  For instance, the analysis done shows that the 10th, 11th, and 12th graders respectively showed a score of 83.1, 83.5, and 83.5 for the average math score.  The calculation I did shows that the 9th graders averaged 83.6.  While it is the highest of the grades, it is not a significant increase.

If we move to the reading, we see that the scores are even closer, with the 10th, 11th, and 12th graders respectively scoring an average of 84.3, 83.6, and 83.8.  The average I found for the 9th graders was 83.7, the second lowest.

###How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
The pass rate deviation was where I did see the biggest change.  The previous pass rates for the district in math, reading, and overall were respectively 75.0, 85.8, and 65.2.  The new pass rates were 74.8, 85.7, and 64.9.  These deviations are a bit more substantial as the students at Thomas account for about 1% of the district population, but the pass rates changes by as much as 0.3 %.

###How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

####Math and reading scores by grade
As described above, the actual scores did not have a very large deviation between grade levels at Thomas.

####Scores by school spending
Thomas fell in to the category of spending $630 to $644 per student.  The rounded average scores and pass rates were identical with or without the 9th graders in the data.  If you look at the unrounded data, the numbers are all marginally higher with the 9th grade students from Thomas in the data. 

####Scores by school size
Thomas fell in to the medium school size category, and the same conclusion can be made as was made in the scores by school spending chart.  No deviation on the rounded averages and pass rates, and some unrounded categories, such as the average reading score, were actually marginally higher.

####Scores by school type
Thomas is a charter school, and the rounded data is identical with and without the 9th graders present.  Some unrounded categories, such as the average reading score, were actually marginally higher.

##Summary
I believe there is something going on here, but the average score in each subject is not where it happened.  Somehow the students were able to not change the average scores drastically, but were able to increase the passing rates for the school by a decent margin.  The pass rates at Thomas for 10th through 12th graders in math, reading, and overall were respectively 93.2, 97.0, and 90.6.  However, if you calculate the pass rate for just the 9th graders at Thomas, you will see that the math, reading, and overall pass rates are 93.5, 98.2, and 91.9.  While this could just be a coincidence, this is a fairly large deviation.  What I would conclude is that students in the middle to lower end of the pack somehow were able to inflate their scores minimally to bump them over the 70 needed to pass the exam.
